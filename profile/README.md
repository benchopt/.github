# Benchopt

_— Simplicity, Transparency, and Reproducibility —_


``Benchopt`` is an open source tool to perform benchmarks of optimization algorithms. It is built to make comparing algorithms

- **Simple** through a user-friendly API/CLI to easily perform and share benchmarks
- **Transparent** by enabling efficient collaborative benchmarks and exposing a myriad of benchmarks results
- **Reproducible** by offering a highly-modular package and standardized approach to make benchmarks

``Benchopt`` aims to reduce the burden of making, validating, and sharing benchmarks to prevent incorrect conclusions when comparing optimization algorithms.
``Benchopt`` handles the tedious part for you so that you can focus on more important things.
